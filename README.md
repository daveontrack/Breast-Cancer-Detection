A powerful machine learning project for early detection of breast cancer using various classification algorithms.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and more
- **Data Visualization**: Beautiful plots showing feature distributions and correlations
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies most significant predictors for breast cancer
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves up to 98% accuracy in classification
- **Easy Deployment**: Simple API for integration with healthcare systems

## 📊 Dataset

We use the renowned [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) containing:

- 569 instances (357 benign, 212 malignant)
- 30 numeric features computed from digitized images
- Features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daveontrack/Breast-Cancer-Detection.git
cd Breast-Cancer-Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from cancer_detector import CancerDetector

# Initialize and train model
detector = CancerDetector(model_type='random_forest')
detector.train()

# Make prediction
sample = [...]  # your feature vector
prediction = detector.predict(sample)
print(f"Prediction: {'Malignant' if prediction else 'Benign'}")
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest       | 0.98     | 0.97      | 0.99   | 0.98     |
| SVM                 | 0.97     | 0.96      | 0.98   | 0.97     |
| Logistic Regression | 0.96     | 0.95      | 0.97   | 0.96     |
| Neural Network      | 0.97     | 0.96      | 0.98   | 0.97     |

## 📝 Usage Example

```python
# Load dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
data = load_breast_cancer()

# Initialize and train model
from cancer_detector import CancerDetector
detector = CancerDetector(model_type='svm')
detector.fit(data.data, data.target)

# Evaluate model
print(detector.evaluate())
```
